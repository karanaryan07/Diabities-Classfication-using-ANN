# Diabities-Classfication-using-ANN
 In this study, a model for diagnosis of type 2 diabetes was developed using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) method.
 a hybrid ANN-Genetic Algorithm model was developed for classification of diabetic patients. Therefore, the number of optimal neurons as well as hidden layers was determined to design the architecture of the ANN model.
 The results showed a precision of 80%% for diagnosing diabetic patients.
